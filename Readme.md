# ** M.E.N.J BOILERPLATE **

this is a boilerplate to build a rest API using Mongo DB , Node Js , Express and JSON Web Token.  

## let's get started  

    - step: 1 clone ot fork the repository on your local system  
    - step: 2 install the node_modules

    ---

    $ yarn install 

    ---

    or 

    ---

    $ npm install

    ---

    - step: 3 start the application

    ---
    
    $ yarn start 

    ---

    or 

    ---

    $ npm start

    ---  


Shortly I'll share the postman api link to test out the existing APIs
